![GRiTS workflow](../.github/grits.png)

GRiTS is a toolkit for working with coarse-grain systems. It uses [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild) to build up molecules and [SMILES](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html) chemical grammar to facilitate the mapping from fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine.
