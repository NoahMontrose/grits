GRiTS is toolkit for working with coarse-grain systems. It uses [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild) to build up molecules and [SMILES](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html)/[SMARTS](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html) chemical grammars to facilitate the mapping from fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine.
